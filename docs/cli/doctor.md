# `nexa doctor`

Health checks + quick fixes for the gateway and channels.

- Security audit: [Security](/gateway/security)

## Examples

```bash
nexa doctor
nexa doctor --repair
nexa doctor --deep
```

Notes:

- Interactive prompts (like keychain/OAuth fixes) only run when stdin is a TTY and `--non-interactive` is **not** set. Headless runs (cron, Telegram, no terminal) will skip prompts.
- `--fix` (alias for `--repair`) writes a backup to `~/.nexa/nexa.json.bak` and drops unknown config keys, listing each removal.

## macOS: `launchctl` env overrides

If you previously ran `launchctl setenv NEXA_GATEWAY_TOKEN ...` (or `...PASSWORD`), that value overrides your config file and can cause persistent “unauthorized” errors.

```bash
launchctl getenv NEXA_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl getenv NEXA_GATEWAY_PASSWORD

launchctl unsetenv NEXA_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl unsetenv NEXA_GATEWAY_PASSWORD
```
